The goal was straightforward: a mahjong table that could live in the house full-time without looking like a dedicated gaming piece. Something that earns its place as furniture first.

## Design

The table is built around a reversible top insert. One side is a hardwood surface that matches the Mahogany frame — a standard table for everyday use. Flip it over and there's a recessed game surface lined with navy blue speed cloth over 1/4" closed-cell foam, which gives the playing area a bit of bounce and keeps tiles from sliding.

The frame, legs, apron, drawer faces, and trim are all milled from solid African Mahogany, with a Mahogany plywood top panel. Internal cross members tie the structure together, provide mounting for the drawers, and create the ledge the reversible insert rests on.

## Joinery & Details

Drawers have Poplar sides riding on Maple rails waxed with paste wax. Rather than hardware pulls, each drawer face has a 1/4" lip routed along the bottom edge — enough to get a finger under while keeping the faces clean.

The reversible insert uses L-shaped trim where the overhang extends 1/2" over the game surface to conceal the ragged fabric edges. The trim connects to the plywood top with dowels and threaded inserts — no glue — so the whole insert can be disassembled later if the speed cloth ever needs replacing.
